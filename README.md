## Setup Instructions

3. **Navigate** to the unzipped folder using command line/terminal
4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   export npm_config_arch=x64
   export npm_config_platform=darwin
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
   Note: `--legacy-peer-deps` is required due to @cliqz/adblocker-electron peer dependency mismatch
